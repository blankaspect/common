================================================================================

This repository contains the source code of packages that are shared by the
seven open-source Blank Aspect Java applications.

The Java version of the source code is 1.8 (Java SE 8).

All the source files in this repo have a tab width of 4.  You can set this when
viewing individual files on GitHub by appending '?ts=4' to the file's URL.  It's
almost effortless. 

The Blank Aspect applications are distributed as installers, executable JARs and
source-code archives through SourceForge:
<http://blankaspect.users.sourceforge.net/>
Each application's source-code archive contains an Ant file for building the
application from source and creating a JAR file.  The source code is published
on GitHub so that it can be browsed without the need to download an archive and
extract its contents.

You may use any of the source code under the terms of the GPL version 3 license.

This repository doesn't contain anything apart from source code because I didn't
want to publish the entire contents of my local repo.  Git doesn't allow partial
clones, so this repository is managed though a secondary local repo and some
scripting.  Until I find an efficient way of publishing a specified subset of
the contents of my local repo, updates of this one will be infrequent, and
commits are likely to have collective (and uninformative) comments.
